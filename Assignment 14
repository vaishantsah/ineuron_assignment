from PIL import Image

# Open the image file
image = Image.open("C:\Users\Super Computer\Downloads\whatsapp20235460.lpg") 

# Get the width and height of the image
width, height = image.size

print("Width:", width)
print("Height:", height)

5. What method would you call to get Image object for a 100×100 image, excluding the lower-left quarter of it?
We can use the crop function to achieve this result.
cropped_image = image.crop((0,50,50,50,100))

6. After making changes to an Image object, how could you save it as an image file?
We use the function save(), where save("name_of_image") takes an argument for the name of the image file.

7. What module contains Pillow’s shape-drawing code?
ImageDraw

8. Image objects do not have drawing methods. What kind of object does? How do you get this kind of object?
To draw on an image, you need to create an 'ImageDraw' object associated with the image. The ImageDraw object provides the drawing methods.
To get an ImageDraw object, you need to use the ImageDraw.Draw() function and pass the Image object as an argument.
