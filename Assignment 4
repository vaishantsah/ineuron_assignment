1. What exactly is []?
[] is known as a list in Python programming.

2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)
Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] for the next three queries.
spam = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
spam[2] = 'hello'

3. What is the value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]?
‘d’ will be the answer.

4. What is the value of spam[-1]?
‘d’ will be the answer.

5. What is the value of spam[:2]?
[‘a’, ‘b’] will be the answer.

Let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat,' True] for the next three questions.
6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?
1 will be the index of the list bacon.

7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?
The list bacon will look - [3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat,' True, 99]

8. How does bacon.remove('cat') and change the look of the list in bacon?
The list bacon after removing ‘cat’ - [3.14, 11, 'cat,' True, 99]

9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?
+ for concatenation and * for replication.

10. What is the difference between the list methods append() and insert()?
. append() adds an item to the end of a list, whereas . insert() inserts and item in a specified position in the list.

11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?
.remove() and .pop() are the two methods for removing items from a list.
12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.
Both are sequences.
13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?
Tuples are immutable whereas lists are mutable which means content of tuples cannot be changed but list content can be changed.
14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?
(42,)
15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?
Use the tuple() function to pass the full list as an argument.
16. Variables that "contain" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?
Variables will contain references to list variables.
17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
The copy() returns a shallow copy of the list, and deepcopy() returns a deep copy of the list
