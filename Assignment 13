1. What advantages do Excel spreadsheets have over CSV spreadsheets?
a. Structure and Formatting: Excel spreadsheets allow for complex data structures and formatting options. They support multiple sheets within a single file, cell merging,
formulas, conditional formatting, and other features that make it easier to organize and analyze data.

b. Data Validation: Excel provides built-in data validation tools that allow you to set rules and restrictions on data entry. You can define data types, specify allowed
values, apply formulas for validation, and create drop-down lists to ensure data integrity.

2. What do you pass to csv.reader() and csv.writer() to create reader and writer objects?
To create a reader object using csv.reader(), you pass a file object that represents the CSV file you want to read.
To create a writer object using csv.writer(), you pass a file object that represents the CSV file you want to write to. 

3. What modes do File objects for reader and writer objects need to be opened in?
For reader objects created using csv.reader(), the file object needs to be opened in read mode ('r').
For writer objects created using csv.writer(), the file object needs to be opened in write mode ('w').

4. What method takes a list argument and writes it to a CSV file?
The writerow() method of a csv.writer object is used to write a single row, represented as a list, to a CSV file. To write multiple rows to a CSV file, you can use the 
writerows() method, which takes an iterable of rows, where each row is a list.

5. What do the keyword arguments delimiter and line terminator do?
The delimiter keyword argument is used to specify the character used to separate fields (columns) within a CSV file. By default, the comma (,) character is used as the 
delimiter. However, you can specify a different delimiter character using the delimiter argument when creating a csv.writer object or reading a CSV file with csv.reader.

6. What function takes a string of JSON data and returns a Python data structure?

7. What function takes a Python data structure and returns a string of JSON data?
